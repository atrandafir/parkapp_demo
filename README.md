This is a demo for a mobile application whose purpose is to help 
you find a free spot where you can leave your car.

It is ment to be used by people who live in a busy city and don't have their own parking 
and have to leave their car in a public one.

So this is not the real application, it is just a demo built for the web using Ruby on Rails.
